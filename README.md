# GIC - The progamming language for FOL

This project was made for educational pourposes, to learn about the implementation of a programming language.

### Features

- **First Order Logic Parsing**: GIC can parse first order logic expressions.
- **Prolog-like Syntax**: The language is designed to be similar to Prolog, making it familiar for those who have used Prolog before.
- **SLD Resolution**: GIC implements SLD resolution for query processing, allowing users to perform logical queries on facts and rules.
